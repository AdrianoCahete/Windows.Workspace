# Windows.Workspace

> This `master` branch doesn't fully tested.

This is intended to me when I install a new Windows instance (and for people who like my workspace or work with me).

This repository have some components and PowerShell Scripts to install my workspace, using Chocolatey and Winget


## :warning: Requirements
- The machine has to have direct access to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` (without authentication process) to download packages
- Install Scripts is just tested with Windows 10 (x64)
- **Create a profile backup before run this install**


## Install
For now, you just need to download the repository as a zip and run `Install.ps1` at root.


## PowerShell Profile
**This Profile will replace your profile. Backup and incremental install are planned.**

:grey_exclamation: This script may need to change Execution Policy to run

Or you can run this command before:  
`Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Confirm`
